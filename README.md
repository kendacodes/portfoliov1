How It's Made:
Tech used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, scss

I updated this template with color changes and slight template adjustments to fit what I was looking for in the moment.

Optimizations
I plan on building a new portfolio from the ground up!


Lessons Learned:
Time and time again I am reminded of why the Developer tool or "inspect" on Chrome browser is such a good tool to utilize. Especially when you are dealing with code that you are not familiar with. It allows you to pinpoint what you want to change and where to locate it and adjust it as you please live and input those changes into your actual code.

Any feedback or recommendations are welcomed!
